## Organization

- Service Control Policies (SCP):
    * whitelist or blacklist IAM actions
    * Applied at the OU or Account level
    * Does not apply to the Master Account
    * SQP must have an explicit Allow (nothing is allowed by default)

- IAM S3, if ends with `/*` => object level permission, otherwise, bucket level permisison.


## IAM Roles vs Resource Based Policies
- When you assume a role, you give up your original permissions and take the permissions assigned to the role.
- When using a resource based policy, the principal doesn't have to give up his permissions.

## AWS Resource Access Manager
- Share AWS resources that you own with other AWS accounts
