- Use VPC sharing to share one or more subnets with other AWS accounts belonging to the same parent organization from AWS Organizations
- VPC sharing (part of Resource Access Manager) allows multiple AWS accounts to create their application resources such as EC2 instances, RDS databases, Redshift clusters, and Lambda functions, into shared and centrally-managed Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs). To set this up, the account that owns the VPC (owner) shares one or more subnets with other accounts (participants) that belong to the same organization from AWS Organizations. After a subnet is shared, the participants can view, create, modify, and delete their application resources in the subnets shared with them. Participants cannot view, modify, or delete resources that belong to other participants or the VPC owner.

- When there are multiple policies in force at the same time, there's a chance that each policy could instruct the Auto Scaling group to scale out (or in) at the same time. For example, it's possible that the CPUUtilization metric spikes and triggers the CloudWatch alarm at the same time that the SQS custom metric spikes and triggers the custom metric alarm.

When these situations occur, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling chooses the policy that provides the largest capacity for both scale-out and scale-in. Suppose, for example, that the policy for CPUUtilization launches one instance, while the policy for the SQS queue launches two instances. If the scale-out criteria for both policies are met at the same time, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling gives precedence to the SQS queue policy. This results in the Auto Scaling group launching two instances. The approach of giving precedence to the policy that provides the largest capacity applies even when the policies use different criteria for scaling in.

AWS recommends caution when using target tracking scaling policies with step scaling policies because conflicts between these policies can cause undesirable behavior. For example, if the step scaling policy initiates a scale-in activity before the target tracking policy is ready to scale in, the scale-in activity will not be blocked. After the scale-in activity completes, the target tracking policy could instruct the group to scale out again.
