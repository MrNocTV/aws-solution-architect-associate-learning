- AWS DMS supports Amazon S3 as the source and Kinesis as the target, so data stored in an S3 bucket is streamed to Kinesis

- Both AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized and AWS Snowball Edge Compute Optimized offer the storage clustering feature.

-  Amazon WorkSpaces is a managed, secure Desktop-as-a-Service (DaaS) solution

- By default, Lambda functions always operate from an AWS-owned VPC and hence have access to any public internet address or public AWS APIs. Once a Lambda function is VPC-enabled, it will need a route through a NAT gateway in a public subnet to access public resources.

- The aws S3 sync command uses the CopyObject APIs to copy objects between S3 buckets. The sync command lists the source and target buckets to identify objects that are in the source bucket but that aren't in the target bucket. The command also identifies objects in the source bucket that have different LastModified dates than the objects that are in the target bucket. The sync command on a versioned bucket copies only the current version of the objectâ€”previous versions aren't copied. By default, this preserves object metadata, but the access control lists (ACLs) are set to FULL_CONTROL for your AWS account, which removes any additional ACLs.

- Amazon EventBridge is recommended when you want to build an application that reacts to events from SaaS applications and/or AWS services.

-  AWS Global Accelerator is easy to set up, configure, and manage. It provides static IP addresses that provide a fixed entry point to your applications and eliminate the complexity of managing specific IP addresses for different AWS Regions and Availability Zones.

- IAM Auth is not supported by ElastiCache.
